I'm not going to bother implementing a "Add/Rate Movie" option as
that is a trivial item.

One additional edit:
 -- added a version number to the trigger_types so that we can track
    which users need to update their profiles when/if new trigger types
    get added
     -- this is in trigger_types.py
     -- also in the users/models.py file
     -- users/views.py has some commented notes indicating where/how
        version would be checked during user login
     -- would probably be able to just re-use the register.html template
        (which would also need to be used in order to allow a user to
        update their settings)

 -- added somes comments in movies/views.py indicating how to easily
    handle accepting an empty string in the search form (in order
    to allow a user to simply list all the movies in the db)

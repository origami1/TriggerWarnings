(See PDF file for initial rough layout and preliminary notes.)

The website framework and logic is in place. 

As this project was mainly intended as a learning exercise,
some items/features that would be trivial to implement
were left out, so that the project could be accepted as
reasonably complete.
- users should be able to add new movies/rate existing movies
- users should be able to edit their profiles
- movie search form should have an option to list all movies
  (this is easily done by just accepting an empty string as a
  search term) (this is sketched out in comments already in the code)
- users should be able to suggest new triggers (admin would have
  to approve) ... all users would be notified on next login
  about new triggers
- add a datetime session cookie to timeout a user's login
- add version number to trigger_types/Profiles (this is sketched out in comments already in the code)
